    The Soil Moisture Accounting and Routing for Transport [SMART] model
    (`Mockler et al., 2016`_) is an enhancement of the SMARG (Soil
    Moisture Accounting and Routing with Groundwater) lumped, conceptual
    rainfallâ€“runoff model developed at National University of Ireland,
    Galway (`Kachroo, 1992`_), and based on the soil layers concept
    (`O'Connell et al., 1970`_; `Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970`_). Separate
    soil layers were introduced to capture the decline with soil depth
    in the ability of plant roots to extract water for evapotranspiration.
    SMARG was originally developed for flow modelling and forecasting
    and was incorporated into the Galway Real-Time River Flow Forecasting
    System [GFFS] (`Goswami et al., 2005`_). The SMART model reorganised
    and extended SMARG to provide a basis for water quality modelling by
    separating explicitly the important flow pathways in a catchment.

    The open water component of SMART consists in routing the streamflow
    through the river network by means of a linear reservoir.
